Installation
------------

To install the latest version of Multitool do the following:

[subs="attributes"]
----
> curl http://{artifactsurl}/multitool/{version}/install-multitool.sh | bash
----

This script downloads and installs the latest `multitool` shell script into `~/.multitool/` and updates any 
local `.bashrc` file.

Setting the platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As explained above Multitool supports all Cascading platforms. In order for Multitool to work, you have to tell it
which platform you want to use. Below we see all ways of setting the platform in order of precedence:

The first way of setting the platform is using the `--platform <name>` command line switch. Valid platform names are
`hadoop`, `hadoop2-mr1` and `local`. The next possibilty is setting the `MULTITOOL_PLATFORM` environment
variable. If that is not set, Multitool will try to use the `CASCADING_PLATFORM` environment variable. If that is also
not set, it will look for a file called `.cascading` in the current working directory. The `.cascading` file is a Java
properties file and can be used to set the platform via the keys `multitool.platform.name` or `cascading.platform.name`.
If no file is present in the current working directory, multitool will look for a `.cascading` file in the user's
`$HOME` directory, which may contain the same keys.

The Multitool shell wrapper will chose `hadoop` as the default platform, if none of the above settings can be found.

.Locating your Hadoop.
****
If you use the `hadoop` platform Multitool will try to locate the `hadoop` command in your environment by searching the
`PATH` and by inspecting the `HADOOP_HOME` environment variable. If no usable `hadoop` script can be found, Multitool
will fail to run. Likewise if you choose to run on the `hadoop2-mr1` platform it tries to locate the `yarn` script that
ships with Hadoop 2 based distributions. It will look in the `PATH`, the `HADOOP_YARN_HOME` and the `HADOOP_HOME`
directories.

If you do not have any version of Hadoop installed, you can use the `local` platform and still benefit from the power of
Multitool and Cascading.
****

Invocation
~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred way of running Multitool is using the shell wrapper coming with the distribution:

----
> multitool param1 param2 .. paramN
----

It is also possible to download the hadoop and/or hadoop2 jar files compatible with your Hadoop version. This is
considered an expert mode of using Multitool. If you are unsure, stick with the full client install.

If you choose to work with the jar files directly, you can download them like so:

Hadoop 1:

[subs="attributes"]
----
> wget -i http://{artifactsurl}/multitool/{version}/latest-hadoop-jar.txt
----

To run it do this:

----
> hadoop jar multitool-hadoop-<version>.jar param1 param2 .. paramN
----

For Hadoop 2:

[subs="attributes"]
----
> wget -i http://{artifactsurl}/multitool/{version}/latest-hadoop2-mr1-jar.txt
----

To run it do this:

----
> yarn jar multitool-hadoop2-mr1-<version>.jar param1 param2 .. paramN
----

****
Please note that you have to set the platform to a valid value, even if you work with the jar files.
****

All downloads are hosted on a public S3 bucket, which makes it easy to deploy Multitool in a bootstrap action an Amazon
EMR cluster.

Update
------

If you want to update Multitool to the lastest version, you can do that like so:

----
> multitool --selfupdate
----

This feature is only available in the shell wrapper and not in the jar files.
