A schedule so tight that it would only work if I didn't sleep on Monday nights.
We're still investigating. I heard that Monday or Tuesday we will probably be having a press conference announcing more.
We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. A little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays.
