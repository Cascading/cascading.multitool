Multitool
========

Welcome
-------

This is the Cascading.Multitool (Multitool) application.

Multitool provides a simple command line interface for building data
processing jobs.  Think of this as `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` for
Hadoop, which also supports joins between multiple data-sets.

See the [Multitool](http://cascading.org/multitool) page for installation and usage.
